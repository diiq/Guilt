Teens ask their mother to borrow the car; you ask Guilt to borrow the internet.

I waste time online. I designed Guilt in order to re-train myself to use the internet only when I need it, and in bite-size chunks.

Guilt is a Chrome extension. Guilt makes a habit of asking you what you'll use the internet for, and allots a short block of time: 5 or 15 minutes. When that time is up, it will mask all open tabs, and ask you if you have finished the job you set out to do.

If the answer is yes, Guilt will close those tabs, leaving you with one new tab, free from distractions.

If the answer is no, you can request another chunk of time in which to work, and all tabs will be accessible again --- until the next time Guilt nags you.

Perhaps Guilt is a little like your mother: "Where are you going? When will you be back? Who will be there? Will there be alcohol?" Guilt's questions, and a log of your answers, help you take time to review your internet-use choices.
